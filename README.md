# hello-world
Just getting started on Git

As a Senior Technical Support Specilist at DigitalGlobe, synthesizing successful deliverables and operations from customer requirements and corporate assets is energizing and drives me to become a trusted adviser for both internal and external customers. 

Driven by results, I advocate for the customer by managing expectations and translating requirements into actionable tasks. These tasks are easily translated into work items and integrated into the Agile development process. 

I am experienced in implementing, managing, and supporting new online products and features, satellite new collection projects, archive delivery projects, and value added production projects. 

I have a passion for geospatial data and how resources can be leveraged to enrich insights and optimize the customer experience. I especially feel that cloud based, "big data", services enrich insight by reducing response times, exposing data to a larger audience, and increasing data efficacy.
